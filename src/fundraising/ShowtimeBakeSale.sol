/// This contract acts as a delegate for listings on the showtime.io marketplace.
/// It allows trustless sales for 3rd parties such as charities.
///
/// Usage:
/// 1. deploy a copy of this contract with the appropriate payees and shares. The payees are immutable and auditable by anyone.
/// 2. anybody can mint a Showtime NFT with the royalties recipient set to the address of this contract
/// 3. the minter transfers (some or all of the editions of) the Showtime NFT to this contract
/// 4. the deployer of the contract calls `createSale`
/// 5. (optional) the deployer calls `renounceOwnership()`, proving that the listing and the remaining supply will be permanently left untouched
/// 6. proceeds from primary sales will accrue in this contract (and secondary sales if it the NFTs use it as the royalties recipient address)
/// 7. anybody can call `release(IERC20 token, address account)` to disperse the funds to the recipients
